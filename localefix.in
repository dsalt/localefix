$BINARY: work around mangled language/locale environment variables

This LD_PRELOAD library is intended for recalcitrant programs which limit
you to a "blessed" set of languages which don't include yours, potentially
causing problems with the likes of date formats.

It alters the initial values of LANG, LANGUAGE, LC_* if needed.
It intercepts setenv() to override considered-bad values.

Syntax:
  [ENVIRONMENT] $BINARY PROGRAM [ARGS...]

Environment:
  _LC_BAD  - target locale without encoding; default "en_US"
  _LC_GOOD - replacement locale with optional encoding; default "en_GB.UTF-8"

Matching of _LC_BAD ignores encodings: the default will match "en_US",
"en_US.UTF-8", "en_US.ISO8859-15" etc.

The replacement locale also enforces encoding (at present; this may change).
